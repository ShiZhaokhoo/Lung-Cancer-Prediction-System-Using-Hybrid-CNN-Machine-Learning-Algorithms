# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-System-Using-Hybrid-CNN-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Using a CT-Scan image to predict the lung cancer. Machine learning algorithms includes Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine()

## Models Used
1. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) - Support Vector Machine(SVM)
2. CNN - Logistic Regression(LR)
3. CNN - Random Forest(RF)

## File Explanation
1. The "**Data_Increasing.ipynb**" file is responsible for generating additional image through data augmentation.
2. The "**Preprocessing_Segmentation.ipynb**" file is involved in both image preprocessing and classification tasks.
3. The "**Lung Cancer Prediction System.ipynb**" file is the main file for the proposed system.
4. The "**dataset**" file stores the lung cancer images, both before and after preprocessing.
5. The "**best_model**" file stores the best model for each type of model used in the system.
6. The "**preprocessing**" file stores the images produced during the preprocessing steps.
7. The "**result**" file stores the images that will be displayed in the Lung Cancer Prediction System.
